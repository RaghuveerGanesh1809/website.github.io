            What is a Full Stack Developer?
        </h1>

        <pre>
                                 A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience 
                                 dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.

                                 Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be built 
                                 by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.

                                 In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, 
                                 and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.

                                 In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. To store user 
                                 data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

                                 The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall 
                                 within the purview of a complete stack developer.

                                 The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end 
                                 and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers 
                                 are in high demand in the software development sector.

            Why Full Stack Developers are in high demand?
        </h4>

        <pre>
                                 There is a great need for full-stack developers for a number of reasons:

                                             <b>1) Versatility:</b> Full-stack developers are very versatile and able to handle a variety of tasks within a team because they have the 
                                                knowledge to work on all facets of a web application.
                                             <b>2) Cost-effectiveness:</b> For a business, engaging a full-stack developer may be more affordable than hiring a number of specialists to 
                                                work on various aspects of a web application.
                                             <b>3) Efficiency:</b> Full-stack developers can work more quickly since they can manage several facets of a project on their own, without 
                                                the assistance of other team members.
                                             <b>4) High demand:</b> The US alone has over 33,000 full-stack developer job vacancies, with an average compensation of over $110,000 per year, 
                                                according to Indeed. Full stack development is an extremely alluring job choice due to the high demand and good pay.
                                             <b>5) Start-up culture:</b> As start-up cultures have developed, there is now a greater need for full-stack developers because they can do 
                                                numerous responsibilities in a smaller team, which makes them perfect for start-up settings.
